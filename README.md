As shown in the screenshots, the intelligence service of Language Studio detected some words that reflect a negative customer opinion about the hotel service being evaluated. Based on these words, there is a calculated percentage of the customer's satisfaction level, which can be extremely useful for the hotel manager's decision-making process.
